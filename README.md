# hello-world
just my first repository

My name is Keigan. I'm a computer science student trying to expand my knowledge as much as possible, and hopefully contribute to some projects while building experience. I have some experience with C#, C++, and JavaScript. Currently my major focus is to broaden my fluency in these languages.
